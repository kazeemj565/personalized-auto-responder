# Personalized Auto-Responder Integration for Telex

## Overview and Purpose

This integration is a "Modifier Integration" designed for the Telex platform. It automatically intercepts incoming messages in a Telex channel and responds with personalized, pre-set replies based on specific keywords or phrases. By detecting keywords such as greetings, help requests, or farewells, the auto-responder helps enhance team engagement, reduce response times for routine queries, and maintain a lively, interactive channel environment.

## Features

- Keyword Detection: Automatically scans incoming messages for pre-defined keywords (e.g., "hello", "help", "bye").
- Predefined Responses: Maps each keyword to a tailored, personalized response (e.g., greeting the sender by name).
- Dynamic Configuration: (Future enhancement) Easily update keyword-response pairs via a JSON configuration file.
- Logging and Error Handling: Basic logging to capture key events and ensure smooth operation.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
- Git installed.
- Access to the telex_integrations GitHub organization (if applicable).

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/kazeemj565/personalized-auto-responder.git
cd personalized-auto-responder


### Creating and Activating the Virtual Environment

1. Create a virtual environment:

    python -m venv venv
    
2. Activate the virtual environment:
    - On macOS/Linux:
    
      source venv/bin/activate
    
    - On Windows:
    
      venv\Scripts\activate
    

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

*Note: The `requirements.txt` file should include packages like `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and `pydantic`.*

### Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server with:

uvicorn src.main:app --reload

You should see output indicating that the server is running, and it will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## High-Level Explanation

The Personalized Auto-Responder integration functions by:
- Intercepting messages: A webhook endpoint receives new messages from the Telex platform.
- Detecting keywords: It parses each message to identify specific keywords.
- Responding automatically: Based on the detected keywords, it sends a personalized reply. For example, if someone says "hello," the integration may respond with "Hi [Name]! How can I help you today?"
- Configuration: The keyword-to-response mappings are stored in a JSON configuration file, allowing for easy updates and future enhancements.

## Future Enhancements

- Dynamic Configuration Interface: Allow non-developers to update keywords and responses through an admin panel.
- Usage Analytics: Log which keywords trigger responses and how often, to help refine the auto-responder.
- Sentiment Analysis: Adjust responses based on the emotional tone of the message.
- Multi-Language Support: Detect the language of incoming messages and reply accordingly.
